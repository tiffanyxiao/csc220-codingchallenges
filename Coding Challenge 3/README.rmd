# Gene Splicing
Objective of Program: Given two strings representing snippets of genes (letters ACGT), identify the shortest string that could contain them both as subsequences.

## How to Run:
1. Run python program "primePantry.py" with command "python" in terminal (note: we are using python 3.6.3) with dictionary, number of items and total as command line arguments.
For example: python primePantry.py() "{'pepsi':55,'detergent':30, 'chips':25, 'cereal':15}" 4 100
Note: The dictionary is incased in double quotes, and each key in the dictionary is incased in single quotes.

## Python Version
