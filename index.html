    <h1> Hello World </h1>
    <h3> Welcome to my website for "csc220-coding challenges" repository </h3>
    <p> CSC 220 is an advanced programming class I am taking / took in the spring of my sophomore year.
    It is a class focused on advanced programming skills in 4 different languages (Python, Javascript, Java
    and Julia) taught by R. Jordan Crouser.</p>
    <h4> Excerpt from Course Description: </h4>
    <p> This course will serve as an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with multiple programming languages through a series of challenging programming exercises. We will explore various techniques and using multiple programming languages including python, JS, Java and Julia. Along the way, we also will discuss important attributes of these languages, such as synchrony vs. asynchrony, dynamic vs. static typing, scalability, expressiveness, and more. While it is not necessary to have familiarity in all of these languages, it is strongly recommended that students be familiar with at least two from this list. Students will also develop good working knowledge of version control, collaborative programming techniques, coding conventions, and documentation.
