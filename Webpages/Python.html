        <h2> Coding Challenges </h2>
        <h3>Coding Challenge #1:</h3>
        write a program that reads all the files in a specified directory and prints a report of the lines that are identical in any pair of files
        <br>
        <h3>Coding Challenge #2:</h3>
        given two strings representing snippets of genes (letters ACGT), identify the shortest string that could contain them both as subsequences.
        <br>
        <h3>Coding Challenge #3:</h3>
        given a dictionary of items and their (integer, positive-valued) item weights, identify whether or not there is a subset that could fill a Prime Pantry Box to exactly 100% and report which items are in the subset
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2> Coding Sprints </h2>
        <h3>Sprint#1:</h3>
        write a short program that takes in a string and prints a well-formed banner to the command line:
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Sprint#2:</h3>
        write a Contact class that stores the following: name, phone number, email address and checks to make sure that the phone number and email address are valid
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Sprint#3:</h3>
        write a program that reads all the python files in a specified directory and prints out the number of lines of code in each (ignoring whitespace and comments)
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Sprint#4:</h3>
        write a @printdebugger decorator that logs the enter/exit of a function \\ #nextlevel1: also log the parameters passed into the function \\ #nextlevel2: indent to show functions that were called from within other functions
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Sprint#5:</h3>
        use dynamic programming to efficiently solve the following riddle
        <br>
        **********************************************************
        <br>
        Given a positive integer n, you can perform any one of the
        <br>
        following 3 steps:
        <br>
        1.Subtract 1.
        <br>
        2.If n is divisible by 2, divide by 2.
        <br>
        3.If n is divisible by 3, divide by 3.
        <br>
        What is the minimum number of steps that takes n to 1?
        <br>
        **********************************************************
        <br>
        <h3>Sprint#6:</h3>
        given a list of integers, return the prime factorization for each (including “PRIME” if the number is prime)
        <br>
        <h3>Sprint#7:</h3>
        given a sequence of (integer, positive-valued) item weights, identify whether or not there is a subset that could fill a Prime Pantry Box to exactly 100%
